## Version Control Basics

**Term:** Repository  
**Definition:** A storage location for your project files and their complete revision history, including all branches and commits.

---

**Term:** Commit  
**Definition:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, recording what changes were made, by whom, and when.

---

**Term:** Branch  
**Definition:** A parallel version of your repository that diverges from the main working project, allowing you to work on features without affecting the main codebase.

---

**Term:** Merge  
**Definition:** The process of integrating changes from one branch into another, combining the histories of both branches.

---

## Git Commands

**Term:** git clone  
**Definition:** Creates a local copy of a remote repository, including all files, branches, and commit history.

---

**Term:** git add  
**Definition:** Stages changes for the next commit, adding modified files to the staging area.

---

**Term:** git commit  
**Definition:** Saves staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message about what was changed.

---

**Term:** git push  
**Definition:** Uploads local repository content to a remote repository, sharing your commits with others.

---

**Term:** git pull  
**Definition:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

---

**Term:** git status  
**Definition:** Displays the state of the working directory and staging area, showing which changes are staged, unstaged, or untracked.

---

## GitHub Concepts

**Term:** Pull Request  
**Definition:** A method of submitting contributions to a project, allowing others to review your changes before merging them.

---

**Term:** Fork  
**Definition:** A personal copy of another user's repository that you can freely experiment with without affecting the original project.

---

**Term:** Issue  
**Definition:** A way to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub, serving as a project's to-do list.

---

**Term:** README  
**Definition:** A markdown file containing information about your project, typically including description, installation instructions, and usage examples.

---

**Term:** .gitignore  
**Definition:** A file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore and not track in version control.

---

## Collaboration

**Term:** Code Review  
**Definition:** The process of examining code changes submitted in a pull request to ensure quality, catch bugs, and share knowledge.

---

**Term:** Merge Conflict  
**Definition:** Occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two commits, requiring manual resolution.

---

**Term:** Remote  
**Definition:** A version of your repository hosted on the internet or network, such as on GitHub.

---

**Term:** Clone  
**Definition:** Creating a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.

---

**Term:** Upstream  
**Definition:** The original repository from which you forked, used to keep your fork synchronized with the source project.

---

## Advanced Concepts

**Term:** HEAD  
**Definition:** A reference to the currently checked-out commit or branch in your repository.

---

**Term:** Staging Area  
**Definition:** An intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

---

**Term:** Working Directory  
**Definition:** The directory on your local machine where you make changes to files, before staging and committing them.

---

**Term:** Origin  
**Definition:** The default name Git gives to the remote repository from which you cloned.

---

**Term:** Fast-forward Merge  
**Definition:** A type of merge where the branch pointer is simply moved forward, possible when there's a linear path between branches.

---

## Best Practices

**Term:** Atomic Commit  
**Definition:** A commit that contains changes related to a single feature or fix, making history clear and reversible.

---

**Term:** Commit Message  
**Definition:** A description of changes made in a commit, following conventions like starting with a verb in present tense.

---

**Term:** Branch Protection  
**Definition:** Rules that prevent collaborators from making certain changes to branches, such as requiring pull request reviews.

---

**Term:** GitFlow  
**Definition:** A branching model for Git that defines a strict branching strategy designed around project releases.

---

**Term:** Continuous Integration  
**Definition:** The practice of automatically building and testing code changes, often triggered by commits or pull requests.
